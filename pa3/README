List.java

	A list data structure that utilizes a bi-directional queue by
	implementing a doubly linked list. It uses a cursor node as a marker
	for iteration purposes. The List is used to entry objects that are
	part of the matrix, in its nodes.

ListTest.java

	A test file provided by the instructor to test the List module. It has 
	been altered to deal with matrix entry objects as its payload rather than
	data that is type int

Matrix.java

	The primary file that supports all the specified matrix operations. It 
	utilizes a private entry class to mark each entry of the matrix. Furthermore
	it is a sparse matrix, which has been implemented using an array of List objects.
	This allows the programmer to load nodes and remove nodes and perform matrix 
	operations using the cursor iteration procedures.

MatrixTest.java

	A test file that has the instructors test code and my own test code. 

Sparse.java

	The main java program. This program takes valid input and output files
	and outputs the information on the matrices that result from various
	operations on the loaded matrices.

Makefile
	
	A recipe to automate the building of the executable jar file Sparse. It is 
	used to speed up the process of compiling java files.

README
	The current file. It presents a table of contents and brief synopsis of
	program files.
